# Diagnosing individual contributor (IC) performance

## Objective
Provide managers with a simple framework for diagnosing underperformance using a skill vs. will matrix.

## Framework: Skill vs. Will matrix

Performance issues often fall into one of four quadrants:

|                 | **High skill**              | **Low skill**               |
|-----------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **High will**   | Ideal performer — support and stretch them | Needs training / coaching — invest in skill development |
| **Low will**    | Disengaged / misaligned — focus on motivation and engagement | Wrong fit — assess role fit and expectations |

---

## How to use this model

When an IC is underperforming:
1. **Assess skill:** Do they know *how* to do the work?
2. **Assess will:** Do they *want* to do the work?

This gives you clarity on where to focus:
- **Low skill, high will:** Prioritize training, coaching, clearer guidance.
- **High skill, low will:** Explore motivation, engagement, burnout, alignment.
- **Low skill, low will:** May indicate a role mismatch or deeper issue.
- **High skill, high will:** No action needed — they’re in a great spot.

## Example diagnostic questions

### To assess **skill**:
- Do they clearly understand what success looks like in this work?
- Have they done similar work before?
- Do they ask questions or seek help appropriately?
- Are they delivering work that meets expectations for quality and completeness?

### To assess **will**:
- Do they seem motivated or energized by this work?
- Do they take initiative beyond what’s asked?
- Are they engaged and contributing in meetings and conversations?
- Have they expressed any dissatisfaction, misalignment, or burnout signs?

## Tips
- Use this as a diagnostic tool, not a label. People can move between quadrants based on circumstances.
- Regular 1:1s are a good time to surface insights related to skill and will.
- Always consider external factors (e.g., personal life, team dynamics) before concluding a "will" problem.
