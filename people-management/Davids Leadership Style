# David's leadership style

## Overview
This document outlines my leadership style and principles, drawing inspiration from *Turn the Ship Around!* by L. David Marquet. The focus is on creating a high-performing, autonomous team where agents take ownership of their work, develop professionally, and contribute to a fast-moving, customer-focused support organization.

---

## 1️⃣ Control and authority
- Agents fully own their tickets and knowledge articles — they know what’s best and should act with autonomy.
- I reserve control for decisions that impact **the customer experience at scale** (e.g., support form design, workflows that affect all customers) because of the larger, long-term consequences.
- My goal is to coach agents so they don’t need to seek permission on day-to-day execution.

---

## 2️⃣ Clarity
- I provide clarity using a **heavily documented wiki/playbook**, where processes, workflows, and examples of “what good looks like” are easy to reference.
- I complement documentation with **simple principles** that allow flexibility and avoid over-prescription.
- I run **team review and calibration sessions** occasionally to ensure shared understanding of quality.

---

## 3️⃣ Competence
- My approach to competence development is mixed and tailored:
  - I act as an escalation point to unblock work quickly.
  - I arrange pairing opportunities with senior agents for targeted skill development.
  - I collaborate to secure **training budgets** (e.g., AWS certifications).
  - I recommend self-directed resources (e.g., Udemy) and help agents schedule dedicated learning time during work hours.
  - I help agents define personalized learning paths aligned to their long-term career goals (whether staying in support or moving into engineering, product, or sales engineering).

---

## 4️⃣ Accountability
- Performance conversations happen in **1:1s**, not in public.
- I use a **standardized dashboard for each agent** showing their metrics alongside:
  - Team goals  
  - Team averages  
- I help agents understand **why metrics matter** and offer strategies for improvement.
- I invite agents to interpret their own data in 1:1s as a shared ownership exercise.
- If performance issues persist, I co-create a short action plan with clear steps and timeframes.
- **No surprises rule:** issues are surfaced early so nothing is unexpected during reviews.

---

## 5️⃣ Communication style
- My default tone is clear, direct, respectful.
- I strongly favor the **"I intend to…" model**:
  - Agents should tell me what they intend to do rather than ask for permission.
  - When things are working as intended, all I need to say is: *"Great — go do that."*
- Coaching points to help the team adopt this model:
  - Explain why this communication style matters (ownership + efficiency).
  - Model it myself in my own updates.
  - Prompt agents when they default to asking permission: *“Instead of asking, tell me what you intend to do and why.”*
  - Acknowledge when they use the language well.

---

## 6️⃣ Trust and respect
- I build trust by maintaining **technical competence** — I aim to be capable of working any ticket so I can be a reliable escalation point.
- I **follow through on commitments consistently** — if I say I will get them access to something or resolve a blocker, it gets done.
- I strive to create an approachable environment where agents feel comfortable raising issues or asking for help.

---

## 7️⃣ Decision velocity
- I strongly prefer **moving fast and breaking things**:
  - No long project plans, excessive weekly reviews, or drawn-out discussions.
  - I favor building something quickly in a test environment and then going live to iterate based on real-world feedback.
  - We are not doing brain surgery — small issues can be fixed faster than they can be preemptively planned away.
- This does **not** mean pushing out sloppy work; we maintain a professional standard.
- Good is better than perfect. The team should always exhibit a **bias toward action**.
