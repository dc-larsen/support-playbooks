# David's leadership style

## Introduction
Years ago, a former teammate suggested I read *Turn the Ship Around!* by L. David Marquet. The ideas in that book fundamentally shaped how I think about leadership: shifting control to the people doing the work, building clarity so decisions can be made confidently, and investing in competence so ownership grows naturally. This document is my way of putting those principles into words — both to hold myself accountable and to give the team a clear picture of how we work together.

## Overview
Our goal is to create a high-performing, autonomous team where teammates take ownership of their work, grow professionally, and contribute to a fast-moving, customer-focused support organization. These principles guide how we operate day to day.

---

## 1️⃣ Control and authority
Teammates own their work — tickets, documentation, and knowledge articles — and have the authority to make decisions in their domain. **Control is reserved** for decisions that impact the customer experience at scale, where the consequences are broader and long-term. Coaching ensures that no one needs permission for day-to-day execution, and as skills grow, so do responsibilities. We regularly assess **fit** to align strengths with the right opportunities.

---

## 2️⃣ Clarity
We build clarity through a **centralized wiki and playbook** that documents processes, workflows, and examples of “what good looks like.” This is paired with **guiding principles** that allow flexibility and avoid over-prescription. Regular **review and calibration sessions** keep the team aligned and ensure we share the same definition of quality.

---

## 3️⃣ Competence
Development is tailored to the individual. We act as escalation points to unblock work quickly, pair teammates for targeted skill-building, secure **training budgets** when possible, and recommend self-directed resources with dedicated learning time during work hours. We also help define **personalized growth paths**, whether someone wants to deepen their expertise in support or move toward engineering, product, or sales engineering. Skills and responsibilities evolve through continuous evaluation of *fit*.

---

## 4️⃣ Accountability
Accountability is handled in private, through **1:1 conversations**. A **standardized dashboard** shows each teammate’s metrics alongside team goals and averages, with the focus on understanding *why* the metrics matter. Teammates interpret their own data as part of a shared ownership model. When performance issues persist, we create a short, clear action plan together. The **no surprises rule** means challenges are surfaced early, so reviews hold no unexpected news.

---

## 5️⃣ Communication style
Our tone is clear, direct, and respectful. We use the **"I intend to…" model** — teammates state their intent instead of asking for permission. When aligned, the response is simple: *"Great — go do that."* We explain why this matters (ownership and efficiency), model it ourselves, prompt when someone defaults to asking, and acknowledge when it’s used well.

---

## 6️⃣ Trust and respect
Trust is built through **technical competence** — leaders should be able to work any ticket they expect the team to handle. We follow through on commitments and ensure that when we say we’ll remove a blocker or secure a resource, it happens. The environment is approachable, and raising issues or asking for help is encouraged.

---

## 7️⃣ Decision velocity
We value **speed and iteration** over long planning cycles. That means avoiding drawn-out project plans, excessive reviews, or slow decision-making. We build quickly in a test environment, launch, and adjust based on real-world feedback. Small mistakes are easier to fix than to prevent through over-planning. We maintain professional standards, but **good is better than perfect** — always favoring a bias toward action.

---

## 8️⃣ Continuous improvement and evolution
This is a living framework, meant to evolve as the team learns, grows, and faces new challenges. We regularly reflect on whether our processes and principles still fit our needs. Feedback is welcome from everyone, and changes are made when they help us move faster, improve quality, or expand ownership. The goal is sustained improvement — building a team that’s better tomorrow than it is today.
