# Meeting culture

## Objective
Define when meetings are useful, expectations for participation, and the preferred approach to communication for this team.

---

## Overall philosophy
- **Default to asynchronous communication** via Slack for routine updates, praise, and feedback.
- **Minimize recurring meetings** — they often waste time and require repetition in 1:1s or Slack anyway.
- Meetings should be reserved for:
  - Rolling out new processes
  - Demoing new tools, workflows, or experiments
  - Real-time discussion required to reach a decision.

## Expectations when meetings happen
- **Cameras on**: Being present is part of being professional in a remote role. The bar is already low for remote work — let's not lower it further.
- **No pre-reading required**: Similar to Amazon’s approach — no one is expected to read materials before the meeting since in practice most people won’t.
- **Active participation**:
  - After the first few volunteers speak up, you will call on individuals for their input.
  - In a small team, hearing from everyone is both feasible and valuable, so this is part of meeting culture.
