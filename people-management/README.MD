## Summary
This section defines principles, expectations, and frameworks for managing people in a customer support environment at a SaaS company. It’s designed to provide clear guidance for how we lead, communicate, and build a healthy, high-performing team.

The approach reflects a leadership philosophy inspired by *Turn the Ship Around!*: creating a culture of shared ownership, technical excellence, and autonomy while maintaining a focus on speed, customer experience, and thoughtful coaching.
